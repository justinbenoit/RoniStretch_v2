		<text><![CDATA[<i><font size="13">Roni Stretch's career path exemplifies how California has attracted a growing number of international artists in recent years. His technique displays a formidable grasp of his medium – oil – that is unusually nuanced and sophisticated, and yet his distinctive large scale portraits also betray a connection to the media – fueled culture that is specific to Southern California. The idea of process – the painstaking execution that transpires over long periods of time, is central to the understanding and appreciation of Stretch’s ambitious oeuvre.</font></i><br/><br/><font size="12">- Wesley Jessup  Executive Director,<br/>  Pasadena Museum of California Art</font>]]></text>

				<image text=""><![CDATA[STATEMENT
The language of the paintings is about the dialogue between the process and the surface. The emotional experience, the visual structure. Always about the observation, not the appearance. The very act of seeing changes what is seen. The synthesis between figurative and abstraction. Painting about limitless possibilities of paint and the relationship of the artist to the very act of making it. Creativity and curiosity, the reconciliation of opposites, where humanity starts within a history of progress and setbacks. This is the world today.

DICHROISM
The property whereby a substance exhibits two different hues or color effects when viewed under different circumstances. Thin Ice and Titanium white, for instance, are examples of oil colors where hues show a marked difference when seen by reflected light and when spread out in a thin layer and viewed by transmitted light. Another example is the property of some oil colors to display a different visual or color effect when brushed vertically than when brushed horizontally on the same area of the canvas.]]></image>

				<image text=""><![CDATA[The Big Bear paintings were created one winter's evening back in the fall of 2000. The photographs I took lasted all of around 45 seconds, as the cars behind me began hooting their horns and getting very impatient realising I had just blocked the only small road leading out of the mountain. The sun was setting and I thought the light and composition worked very well.  Not realising at that moment what I had, those few shots enabled me to create a series of over 130 paintings some ten years in the making. ]]></image>

Back to the drawing board
Ironic postmodernism has played itself out, Donald Kuspit says. He's pushing the art world toward a return to mastery.
By Leah Ollman<br/>Special to The Times<br/>March 6, 2005
After delivering a lecture at Yale a few years ago, art historian and critic Donald Kuspit strolled through the university's art studios, as is his habit when traveling, to see what students were up to. One encounter that day summed it up:
"I went into the studio of a young woman and asked to see her work," he recalls. "She said: 'I have no work. I'll show you a tape of my professors criticizing me for not working. That's my work. They came to my studio and asked me why I wasn't doing anything. But I said: "I am doing something. I'm filming you." ' "
Get Kuspit started, the way he was before a packed house at Hermosa Beach's Gallery C recently, and he'll give example after example of what he calls "the end of art." The cover of his newest book, by that title, bears a photograph of an ashtray filled with cigarette butts. It's not just an emblem of something used up and snuffed out but another illustration of Kuspit's claim that too much contemporary art merely throws the banality of everyday life right back at us, unexamined, untransformed. The image is by British artist Damien Hirst, who made art world headlines and elicited rest-of-the-world chuckles in 2001 when a janitor swept one of his installations of deliberately strewn debris into the trash.
"Making art," Kuspit grumbles in his book, "has become a case of putting on the emperor's new clothing and getting away with it — calling raw life interesting art and convincing people that it is."
Kuspit, 69, is not a straggly-bearded outsider wandering barefoot with a sign proclaiming that the end is near. He's a tweedy-looking professor of art history and philosophy (State University of New York at Stony Brook) with a handful of doctorates to his name and more than 30 books to his credit ("The Rebirth of Painting in the Late 20th Century" and "Psychostrategies of Avant-Garde Art" among them) proclaiming that the end is here.
Art, he says, has become a decadent farce. He cites work such as Hirst's and the episode with the Yale student as persuasive proof. This kind of "postaesthetic art" — art that repudiates beauty, that takes its inspiration from the street rather than the studio, from popular culture rather than the unconscious — demands to be taken on faith. Its dominance now, he asserts, is evidence that the contemporary art scene functions like a cult. Whether Kuspit fancies himself a deprogrammer or the authoritative leader of an opposing sect is a matter of interpretation.
Some hail his literate rants against the status quo as brave.
"I think it's a really important corrective," comments artist Ruth Weisberg, dean of the school of fine arts at USC and one of a dozen or so artists singled out for praise in Kuspit's book and included in a Gallery C show that Kuspit curated. "The art world gets extremely self-involved and sometimes loses a wider perspective, both human and art historical. [Kuspit's argument] is healthy and provocative in a good way."
Others laugh at Kuspit's psychoanalysis-steeped traditionalism.
"You mean there's another end-of-art book out there?" scoffs Dave Hickey, a teacher, curator and critic. "He should write about the end of Freud. That's more likely to happen sooner. Donald's crazed."
Kuspit's views on where we are, art-wise, how we got here and especially on where we ought to go from here are passionately declamatory and usually spicily defamatory too. Tossing them into conversation ensures a lively joust. They highlight divisions that already exist within the art world, though people who hear him out don't necessarily fall neatly along party lines. Even some who dismiss Kuspit's conclusions find themselves agreeing with some of his premises, especially his assertion that postmodernism has played itself out.
"I'm in agreement with him that things are kind of boring right now," says Hickey, who teaches writing at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas and is a guest professor and curator at Otis College of Art and Design in Los Angeles this year. "How could you disagree with that? You know how army ants sometimes go around and around in a circle until they all die? I think we may be in that situation."
Architects of the end
Kuspit points to Marcel Duchamp as the original leader of this suicide brigade. His "readymades," common objects such as bottle-drying racks and urinals taken out of their functional context and presented as found sculpture, dissolved the difference between art and nonart. That difference is crucial, according to Kuspit. Without it, the whole relationship between artist, artwork and spectator turns farcical. Owing to Duchamp, the act of making art shifted away from the hand to rest entirely in the mind. Duchamp discredited and undermined the aesthetic. His doing so, Kuspit writes, was "a triumph of destructiveness that has corrupted twentieth century creativity."
After Duchamp, in Kuspit's chronology of culprits, comes Allan Kaprow. His "happenings" of the late 1950s and early '60s launched the broader practice of performance art, kin to conceptual art and embodiment of the belief that life is superior to art — or as Kaprow has written, "nonart is more art than Art art." Kaprow's influence has been damaging, Kuspit says. He wrote "some very important essays about what he called 'postart' and the 'unartist.' Very brilliant mind, but wrongheaded. Postart blurs the boundaries between art and life, to the detriment of the aesthetic. His position is that if you look in the mirror and brush your teeth in the right way, it's art."
Artists from the '70s to the present have been schooled more in the basics of conceptual thought and theory than in the fundamentals of drawing and painting.
So here we are, in the early 21st century, reaping the harvest of Duchamp's and Kaprow's legacies — mopping up the dead ants.
If modern art was characterized by a sense of breakthrough and experimentation, postmodern art, laments Kuspit, is its exhausted aftermath. It's all about irony, apathy and disillusionment. It has become all business and entertainment. He longs for artists who have a profound faith in art, who see it as a lofty calling rather than a cynical career.
"It sounds like he's having an old-fogy response," says Lynn Zelevansky, curator and head of the modern and contemporary art department at the L.A. County Museum of Art. "It's still very, very hard to be an artist, and you couldn't sustain that without believing in it. It's still a very hard life. The only reason to do it is because you have to."
Of Kuspit's position, she adds, "One gets to a point when one's no longer in sync with the culture, when one's out of touch with today's younger culture-makers. For some people that happens before they're 40, for others, not till they're 70. We all have to be careful about that. I'm sure in [Kuspit's] youth, there were older people telling him that the art he believed in was the emperor's new clothes."
If, as Kuspit claims, art has been trivialized, how can it be reinvested with meaning and potency? By dealing with the beautiful and the important, he says. "Coleridge said that what the artist is about is finding the moment of transcendence in the everyday, the moment of the lyrical in what looks banal."
In his book, Kuspit names a number of artists he thinks defy postaesthetic art's rampant cleverness, among them Jenny Saville, April Gornik, Lucian Freud and Julie Heffernan. He credits them with helping to restore humanism to art and reaffirming the value of technical skill. He's dubbed them "New Old Masters" for their synthesis of critical sensibility with traditional training.
Kuspit has also identified two dozen "New Old Masters" working in California and gathered their work — mostly painting, drawing and prints — in a show at Gallery C. The selection includes Dan McCleary's contemplative portraits, Sandow Birk's contemporary history paintings, Weisberg's fusion of art history and lived experience, Marc Trujillo's distilled urban scenes, Robert Schwartz's allegories, Masami Teraoka's updates on Japanese woodblock prints, the late James Doolin's Southern California landscapes, Enjeong Noh's figurative scenes, Guy Diehl's still lifes in homage to earlier artists, and more.
Kuspit flew in from New York for the opening in late January and lectured to the standing-room-only crowd about how this art is "the new frontier of innovation and artistic thoughtfulness."
Roni Stretch, whose meticulously painted spiritual portraits are one of the highlights in the show . Kuspit says ,"It takes a lot of guts to say some of the things Stretch is saying. Major writers and critics are not very likely to say that figurative art or representational art is still a main force in painting." 
Indeed, Kuspit's endorsement of traditional academic skills doesn't convince everyone.
"I'm all in favor of people knowing how to do what they do," Hickey says, "but whenever people talk about returning to art, they're talking about going back to drawing from casts. I think that's corny." As for the "New Old Masters' " fusion of traditional skills and critical sensibility, Hickey finds it self-evident. "It's my opinion that most professional artists have that."
Counters Kuspit: "I've gotten a fair number of letters from artists saying they're very glad I've said what I've said. Often they're young people who want the skills. Some students think they're being sold short. They want to work from the model."
Kuspit laments that younger artists don't know how to master a medium, but perhaps, says LACMA's Zelevansky, he's defining his media too narrowly. "Maybe they know other things that he doesn't know. Knowing how to draw is a kind of intelligence; you can't dismiss that. But on the other hand, the world has changed a lot, and young people today have skills and abilities that are different, with computers and other things, and that will be its own technique eventually."
Kuspit savors the contradiction in his role as well-amplified voice in the wilderness. It comes as no surprise to him that the kind of work he's championing is not on the top of many museum curators' "must see" lists.
"Our art scene is supposed to be so innovative, but it's an inertial system with vested interests," he says. "It's not so open. Curators and museum directors are on the avant-garde treadmill. It used to be that avant-garde art was outsider art. Now it's insider art."
All the more reason for artists such as F. Scott Hess, whose emotionally charged paintings are in the Gallery C show, to be grateful for Kuspit's attention. "LACMA and [the Museum of Contemporary Art] are not going to look at this stuff unless they get some sort of impetus from outside of L.A. When Kuspit talks, people are going to listen. It's not as if he's approaching art in a light way or is trying to score political points. He's coming to this art after looking for so long.
"The strength of the work is that it connects with human beings in a very direct way. It's not ironic. It's meant in a quite sincere fashion, and that's maybe what he responds to. He's sick of the cheap joke. These are people nailing their hearts to the wall, and that takes some courage."

		<dichromaticreview><![CDATA[RONI STRETCH
DICHROMATICS
The most effective way to see the star cluster of the Pleiades, or Seven Sisters, is to face the correct direction, but to look slightly to the left or right of the constellation. This simple act throws the indistinct smudge of this stellar constellation into sharp relief. A similar activation of peripheral vision is also fruitful when viewing the paintings of Roni Stretch. In works such as John naphthol crimson, tapestry red and Figure sap green, grey birch (both 2003), what at first appear to be flat rectangles of a single color reveal their inner cargo of a hidden face or figure by this simple act of shifted vision. Alternately the image is gradually revealed after extended contemplation; like a person slowly approaching us through a thick chromatic mist. 
This series of paintings are ‘Dichromatic’ in that they are made up of alternating layers of two different colors, such as sap green and paynes grey, burnt sienna and terre verte, raw sienna and grey smoke. Stretch initiates the process by painting a photo-realistic underpainting, allowing the image to dry, colors are then applied in a translucent state. Both colors function equally in the chromatic structure of the painting. For example, Claritza uses a combination of oil, napthol  crimson and long oil alkyd resin, tapestry red. The initial impression is of a five-foot by four-foot, red monochrome, minimalist painting, but emerging from the depth of the seemingly solid color is the ‘portrait’ of a young woman, her eyes, dark hollows, the lower part of her face submerged in shadow. It is not so much a portrait of a particular person as the anthropomorphic evocation of the presence of the painting itself. It is as if by giving an abstract painting a ‘human face’ Stretch has given the viewer an entrance into what would otherwise be decoded as an artifact of late modernism.
Stretch edits heavily, resulting in paintings that are not so much painted over as optically embedded within the multiple layers of alternating colors, it is part of the fabric of the abstract facture; abstract field and figurative image have been fused into a unique form of painting, one which partakes of seemingly opposite aspects on the continuum of painting, but allows them to coexist together, and instead of canceling each other out they combine to form a ‘new third state’ of painting.

		<portraitsreview><![CDATA[Roni Stretch’s Dichromatic Portraits:  Presence As Purity 
My first response to Roni Stretch’s paintings was:  how extraordinarily exquisite, and how original.  I knew of nothing quite like them in the history of modern, let alone traditional art:  an ingenious, convincing integration of color field painting, Minimalist structure, and photo-realist portraiture.  Cutting edge postmodern for sure, for Stretch’s Dichromatic Portraits synthesize what are usually regarded as incommensurate--not simply abstract  ion and representation, but pure painting, with its effect of hermetic immediacy and aesthetic self-sufficiency. 
In other words, Stretch ingeniously reunites what such pioneering abstractionists as Malevich and Mondrian separated:  the non-objective and the objective.  Stretch’s surfaces are sensuously elegant; the images embedded in them deviously evident, as though the sensuous surface was some cognitive veil.  He’s clearly forcing the limits of perception, suggesting that we always stand on the thr  eshold between blindness and (in)sight:  it’s as though the images are blind spots that suddenly become visible inside us, indicating that they are our own mental representations rather than externally real--which helps explain their ghostly, auratic presence and precious intangibility.    	
This idea led me to my second response:  Stretch’s paintings are meditational exercises.  Their perfectionism is at once spiritual and technical:  the realization of perfect consciousness--and all art is ultimately about states of consciousness--and the seamless integration of figure and ground that symbolizes it.  The eureka moment of “re-cognition”-- the instant we become conscious of the face within the inscrutable surface, as though it was some hallucinatory projection of our own (the moment when we are inside the painting not simply contemplating it from the outside, a “seeing in” that suggests that the face we see is our own mask)--is the classic moment of enlightenment.  
The paintings are in fact conceptual, for both the portrait and the surface exist as Platonic ideas however physically real. Ironically, their conceptual aspect is made clear by the system of their making: the sitter is photographed, a particular photograph chosen, a photo-realistic rendition of the photograph is painted-- similar to the way a design functions as the template guiding the painting of a fresco-- and then overpainted with two alternating layers of color, the second applied after the first has dried. 
 Stretch’s paintings are not only meticulously executed, but polished with a certain Renaissance reserve, as the final application of three layers of resin suggests. These hide the marks of the work that went into the painting; Castiglione insisted that a true master must always do so, as final proof of his mastery, and also to add the lu  stre and resonance of the everlasting to the image.  Stretch does not simply paint over the initial underpainting - the camera becomes the painter’s observing second eye ,the photograph the preliminary drawing--but eternalizes or idealizes it by ”re-envisioning” it as the perfect monochromatic picture plane.
Stretch’s sublime handling reminds us that Conceptualism’s dismissal of craft and the material medium (the so-called dematerialization of art) was a mistake to begin with. Not only does Stretch’s high craft correct it, but seems to demonstrate that the process of making a material painting can reflect the idea immanent in the painting by way of its own reflective character.  
In other words, process can be a mode of deliberation as well as the means of achieving a product worth the contemplative trouble.  The process has to be reflective if the work is to rise above the mundane reality that is its point of departure, which Stretch’s transcendental paintings do.
