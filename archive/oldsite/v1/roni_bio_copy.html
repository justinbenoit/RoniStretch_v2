      Roni Stretch, born into a working class family just outside of Liverpool, 
      England, began exploring the world of art at the age of five. The understanding 
      of perspective and the attention to detail were so unusual, especially for 
      someone so young, that Roni&#146;s drawings were taken to a child psychologist 
      to be analyzed. His school`s preoccupation with his ability eventually gave 
      him a complex about his artistic talent so he put down his paint brushes, 
      and stepped out of the spotlight.<br>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-7">Some twenty 
        years later, Roni found himself back in the limelight when he was spotted 
        by Elite Model Agency in London. Soon he began traveling the globe, being 
        photographed for many the world&#146;s top designers, modeling taught 
        him many things with regard to the human figure: a way of seeing modes 
        of movement, light and shadow interplaying, and the unforgiving eye of 
        the camera as it records all. These experiences combined with the contemporary 
        scenes of fashion, sports, and music served as an inspiration and subject 
        matter for many of his future paintings.<br>
        <br>
        A little over ten years ago Roni settled in California, through the encouragement 
        of a fashion editor Roni renewed his passion for art. He rediscovered 
        the voice of his five year old self. Today, Roni`s work combines the formal 
        aspects of the Abstract Expressionists with his own brand of sensitivity, 
        charm and wit. Represented in New York by the Steve Michel gallery and 
        recently appointed by both the Peoples Choice and the American Music Awards 
        as their official artist and by the U.N. to produce a canvas monument 
        to celebrate each of the fifty states of America, Roni is fast becoming 
        an international art figure.<br>
        <br>
        Roni has chosen football as the inspiration for his latest series of works.An 
        exhibition of these works will be on display in london spring 2002, followed 
        by a global tour of these and other works.<br>
        <br>
        &quot; In a world where our lives are saturated with images from the obsure 
        to the every day, art seems needlessly to struggle while trying to cross 
        boundaries. The action and ideal of my work is to convert the stigma associated 
        with abstraction by choosing themes with which every body can relate. 
        With the universal game of football, I truly hope my images will extend 
        the normal parameters and increase the interest in art .&quot; <br>

        <br>
        Q - What inspired you to start painting?<br>
        A - A painting on a wall in an apartment my friend was staying at triggered 
        this whole journey. I felt I had painted it. <br>
        <br>
        Q &#150; Which painters do you admire most?<br>
        A &#150; Many different, for different reasons, constantly changes, today 
        I&#146;d say, Avery, Rothko, De Kooning, Heron, Diebenkorn, Valdes, Turner. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Q &#150; What has the high point been in your career so far?<br>
        A &#150; In such a short career to date, I seem to have had many. When 
        the first serious collector viewed my work and left my studio with some 
        22 pieces later, remarking as he left &quot;now go and paint!&quot; <br>
        <br>
        Q &#150; What inspired your recent works?<br>
        A &#150; Diebenkorn&#146;s Ocean Park series really enabled me to view 
        my compositions in such a geometric way that bridged my gap from realism 
        to abstraction. By leaving all my evidence in the development of the work 
        also really freed me up.Today, I&#146;m very interested not solely in 
        the subject matter but the process. <br>
        <br>
        Q &#150; How would you spend your last ten bucks?<br>

        <br>
        Q &#150; What can you see from your bedroom window?<br>
