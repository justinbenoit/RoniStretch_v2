<p>&#145;Roni Stretch, a young man who is predicted to make a significant impact 
  on art in the 21st Century&#146;<br>
  We will be seeing great things from the brush of this young artist&#146;<br>
  Dick Clark</p>
<p>&#145;Exceptional talent&#146;<br>
  Magic Johnson</p>
<p>&#145;Roni Stretch did the first portrait of me that I ever valued. As a collector 
  of Hockney, Picasso and Miles Davis,I&#146;ve come to appreciate and love Roni&#146;s 
  work as much as anyone&#146;s.&#146;<br>

<p>&#145;It is his total comprehension of the internals and externals of the human 
  body that give his work a seamless quality&#133;There is something that goes 
  beyond all fashion in his work this is style.&#146;<br>
  William A Emboden,Ph.D.,FLS<br>
  Author of the Visual Art of Jean Cocteau<br>
  and Leonardo Da Vinci<br>

<p>&#145;The paintings were beautiful&#133;The work absolutely original.There 
  are elements of Kandinsky and sometimes Juan Gris, but Francis Picabia shines 
  through&#133;Sleeping Nude is incredible.She is polished and primitive at the 
  same time.&#146;<br>

  Orange Coast Weekly-exhibition review 1997&#146;Art d&#146; Haute Vive&#146;</p>
<p>&#145;The bold and brilliant colors captivated me, the flowing line of his 
  subjects put me in the place depicted.I only wish I had more wall space to hang 
  more of Roni&#146;s work&#146;.<br>

<p>&#145;This is the only contemporary artist that I have seen that I was so moved 
  by that I really personally want to get involved with&#133;An evolution of artistry 
  that can go from one medium to another..&#146;<br>
  Tony Clarke<br>
  Director,Severin Wunderman Museum<br>
  California.</p>
<p>&#145;I have seen his wonderful talent and true gift as an artist.He has an 
  amazing ability for capturing and portraying within his art, the true essence 
  of an emotion or reflecting a moment in time.&#146;<br>
  Roy Ullyet OBE</p>
<p>&#145;The brilliant colors and smooth lines express emotion and excitement. 
  There is definite talent here.&#146;<br>

<p>&#145;What verve! Every modern master is brought to mind, from Picasso to Chagall, 
  yet Roni Stretch displays an originality that is uniquely his own. His work 
  sings!&#146;<br>

<p>&#145;I read a quote once written by Sir Joshua Reynolds, it said ,~Taste does 
  not come by chance, it is a long and laborious task to acquire it~ Knowing and 
  working with Roni, his laborious commitment to his art, his unique talent and 
  his ability to create such emotion with a flicker of color, epitomizes the word 
  taste.&#146;<br>
